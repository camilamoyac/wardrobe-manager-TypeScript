# Overview

This project is a small TypeScript-based wardrobe manager designed to explore and demonstrate core TypeScript concepts in a practical way. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of type definitions, classes, interfaces, custom error handling, and recursion while building something structured and easy to extend.

The software lets users add, update, delete, categorize, and randomly generate outfits from their wardrobe. I also implemented nested category structures using recursion, which allowed me to work with tree-like data in TypeScript. Throughout the project I focused on writing clean, strongly typed code and learning how TypeScript improves reliability compared to plain JavaScript.

This project serves as a personal step toward writing more maintainable, scalable software and becoming more comfortable designing modular systems with TypeScript.

# Development Environment

I built this project using:

- Visual Studio Code as the main editor
- Node.js to run TypeScript outside of the browser
- ts-node, tsconfig, and ES module imports for TypeScript execution
- Standard TypeScript features such as classes, interfaces, type aliases, custom error classes, recursion, and strict typing

The programming language used was TypeScript, with no external libraries—everything was implemented using built-in language features to focus on understanding the syntax itself.

# Future Work

- Add persistence so the wardrobe is saved (e.g., JSON file or localStorage in a web version)
- Improve the outfit generator by considering color matching
- Add more item types (jackets, accessories, etc.) and filtering options
